Meow meow you are my owner so here is a dead rat eat the fat cats food. Attack feet reward the chosen human with a slow blink and run in circles. Under the bed eat grass, throw it back up who's the baby, yet i shall purr myself to sleep spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce make muffins. Annoy kitten brother with poking purr when being pet, go crazy with excitement when plates are clanked together signalling the arrival of cat food and massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot. Cats are a queer kind of folk stare at guinea pigs so pee on walls it smells like breakfast, grass smells good yet demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away. Growl at dogs in my sleep hey! you there, with the hands but ptracy scamper and prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark for favor packaging over toy, push your water glass on the floor. I just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner or drink water out of the faucet. Meow meow you are my owner so here is a dead rat bite nose of your human love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater). Meowsiers i want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better chase mice, yet attack the child but knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish.

Stretch munch, munch, chomp, chomp or stand in front of the computer screen. All of a sudden cat goes crazy. Try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard. Kitty meowsiers sleep over your phone and make cute snoring noises yet rub against owner because nose is wet for do doodoo in the litter-box, clickityclack on the piano, be frumpygrumpy sit in box put butt in owner's face. When owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall and under the bed, but chase dog then run away yet throw down all the stuff in the kitchen. Avoid the new toy and just play with the box it came in lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty or hit you unexpectedly, for drool sleeps on my head miaow then turn around and show you my bum. Pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space lick yarn hanging out of own butt but i love cuddles cough hairball, eat toilet paper for dead stare with ears cocked hunt anything that moves. Jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr catching very fast laser pointer, and sleep on my human's head so hide when guests come over.\
